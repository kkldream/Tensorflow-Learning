# About Dataset

## Context

A good data set for notebook developpers to use various augmentation techniques to build a high F1 score model

## Content

This is a data set of images of various types of balls. There are 24 different types (classes) . train set includes 2860 files in 24 subdirectories.
The training set is not balanced having a different number of images for each class. This was done intentionally so notebook developers could test methods to deal with unbalanced data. The data set is however of high quality where the region of interest (ROI), the ball typically comprises about 50% of the pixels.
